- Authentication is the process of determining whether someone or something is, in fact, who or what it says it is.
- There are several authentication types. For purposes of user identity, users are typically identified with a `user ID`, and authentication occurs when the user provides credentials such as a password that matches their user ID
- **Single-factor authentication SFA** is the simplest form of authentication method. With SFA, a person matches one credential to verify himself or herself online. The most popular example of this would be a password (credential) to a username.
- **Two-factor authentication (2FA)** is an identity and access management security method that requires two forms of identification to access resources and data.
- **Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)** is an authentication method that requires the user to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to a resource such as an application, online account, or a VPN.
- **Why is authentication important in cybersecurity?**
    Because it enables organizations to keep their networks secure by permitting only authenticated users (or processes) to access their protected resources, which may include computer systems, networks, databases, websites and other network-based applications or services.
- **What is authentication used for?**
    Authentication is used by a client when the client needs to know that the server is system it claims to be. In authentication, the user or computer has to prove its identity to the server or client. Usually, authentication by a server entails the use of a user name and password.

    - `Knowledge factor`. The knowledge factor, or something you know, may be any authentication credentials that consist of information that the user possesses, including a personal identification number (PIN), a username, a password or the answer to a secret question.
    - `Possession factor`. The possession factor, or something you have, may be any credential based on items that the user can own and carry with them, including hardware devices, like a security token or a mobile phone used to accept a text message or to run an authentication app that can generate a one-time password (OTP) or PIN.
    - `Inherence factor`. The inherence factor, or something you are, is typically based on some form of biometric identification, including fingerprints or thumbprints, facial recognition, retina scan or any other form of biometric data.
