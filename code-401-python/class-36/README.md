## Data Fetching 
### What is SWR

- SWR stands for `stale-while-revalidate`, a HTTP cache invalidation strategy popularized by HTTP RFC 5861. It basically means that it performs data fetching in 3 steps:

    1. Returns cached data first (stale)
    2. Sends the fetch request (revalidate)
    3. Returns the up-to-date data
- SWR is created by **Vercel** and one of its advantages is that it is a fast and lightweight package.
- **Why use SWR?**
    1. Built-in Cache + Real-Time Experience
        Using SWRâ€™s strategy, the user sees the cached (stale) data first and requests are `automatically being cached`. Components will always be constantly updated with the most recent data, ensuring UI will always be `fast and reactive.`
    2. Auto Revalidation
        - SWR ensures that the user sees the most up-to-date data. So even with multiple tabs or windows, the data is always fresh and in sync when the window/tab is refocused.
        - SWR can also revalidate data on interval, to make sure multiple sessions will render the same components based on the data.
        - In the event the user disconnects from the internet, SWR will automatically revalidates data once the user is online again.

    3. Pagination
        Instead of having to write your own logic with Fetch or Axios to paginate data or create an infinite loading UI for your app, SWR provides a simple Hook called `useSWRInfinite` to handle this for you.
