- **Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:**

  | SQL | NoSQL |
  | --- | ----- |
  |  Relational Databases   |   non-relational or distributed database    |
  | table based    |  document, key-value, wide-column, and graph     |
  | has predefined schema  |  has dynamic schema for unstructured data.     |
  |  vertically scalable   |  horizontally scalable     |

 * **What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?**
 complex query intensive environment
*  **Give a real world example.**
analyze your grocery shopping habits
  * **What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?**
  NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data.
  * **Give a real world example.**
  Document-oriented (hierarchy) database, like mongodb
  * **Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?**
  NoSQL database
  * **Which type of database is best for scalability?**
  SQL databases

*  **What does SQL stand for?**
Structured Query Language
* **What is a relational database?**

* **What type of structure does a relational database work with?**
a table that contains organizing data into rows and columns
* **What is a 'schema'?**
A database schema defines how data is organized within a relational database; this is inclusive of logical constraints such as, table names, fields, data types, and the relationships between these entities[1]
* **What is a NoSQL database?**
non-tabular databases and store data differently than relational tables.
* **How does it work?**
it stores data in documents rather than relational tables.
*  **What is inside of a Mongo database?**
data records as BSON documents.
* **Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.**
MongoDB is more flexible, because each collection need not have the same set of fields
* **What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?**
Compatibility issues with SQL instructions
