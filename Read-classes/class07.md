## REST

### How I explained REST to my brother

* **Who is Roy Fielding?**
    Roy Thomas Fielding is an American computer scientist, one of the principal authors of the HTTP specification, and the originator of the Representational State Transfer architectural style. He is an authority on computer network architecture and co-founded the Apache HTTP Server project.[1]


* **Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?**
    Because they weren't designed to be used like that. most of the techniques developers used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements. You just needed to talk to a small group of machines.

* **What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?**
The Hypertext Transfer Protocol is an application layer protocol in the Internet protocol suite model for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems[2].

* **What does a GET do?**
request data from a specified resource.
* **What does a POST do?**
Send data to a server to create/update a resource.
* **What does PUT do?**
