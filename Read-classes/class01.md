# Class 01 
## Introduction to React and *Components*

### Component-Based Architecture

* **What is a “component”?**
    it is like JavaScript functions. it accepts arbitrary inputs (called *“props”*) and returns React elements describing what should appear on the screen 
    
* **What are the characteristics of a component?**
    **1.** Composing: use the same component abstraction for any level of detail.
    **2.** Extracting: split components into smaller components.

* **What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?**
    It lets you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.


### What is Props and How to Use it in React

* **What is “props” short for?**
    *"Properties"*
* **How are props used in React?**
    there are two ways to use props: one without destructuring and the other with restructuring.
    * use props without restructuring
        1. Pass in props as an argument.
        2. Declare props variable(s).
        3. Use variable(s) in JSX template.
        4. Pass data to props in the React component

    *  use props with restructuring:
        It is the same as the first way but instead of passing props as an argument, it is destructured and passed in the variables as the function's argument.
* **What is the flow of props?**
    Pass data from one component to another (from a parent component to a child component(s))


## Things I want to know more about:
* build an interactive tic-tac-toe game with React.
